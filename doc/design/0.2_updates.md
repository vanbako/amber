Amber 0.2 Updates

- Added a 24-bit unconditional branch in the single-slot format (opcode 8): target = `PC + (imm13 << 4)`. No writeback.
- Added 24-bit conditional branches: `beq` (opcode 9) and `bne` (opcode A). Encoding uses `rd4` and `rs3` (r0..r7) plus signed `imm13` in bundle units (16B).
- Gowin build script now emits a minimal ROM image containing a self-branch in slot 0 to exercise fetch/branch/retire on hardware.
