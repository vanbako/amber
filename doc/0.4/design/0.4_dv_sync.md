# Amber 0.4 Coherence DV Sync (2025-10-05)

## Summary

- Walked DV owners through the refreshed Amber Coherence Fabric description so the protocol names (`ReqRd`, `ReqRdx`, `RespData`, `SnpInv`, `SnpClean`, `NC`) match both design docs.
- Called out the updated references in `doc/0.4/design/0.4_microarchitecture.md:58` and `doc/0.1/design/system.md:57` so DV can link coverage models back to the spec.

## Action Items

- **DV:** Update the coherence scoreboard and eviction tests to exercise `ReqRdx` upgrades, snoop-triggered LOAN expiry handling, and non-coherent `NC` transactions by 2025-10-12.
- **Design:** Provide the DV team with example trace captures of LOAN-triggered `SnpInv` events once the RTL instrumentation lands (tracked in `doc/0.4/design/0.4_microarchitecture.md:89`).

## Notes

- Shared the slide deck and spec links on the DV team channel (message archived 2025-10-05 14:20 UTC) so the entire group has the revised wording.
- DV leads acknowledged receipt and confirmed their plan to mirror the terminology in the coverage plan rev due next week.
